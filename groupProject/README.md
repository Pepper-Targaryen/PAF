**Introduction**

In this PAF
project (Projet d’Application Finale à Télécom ParisTech), our goal is to
implement Artificial Neural Networks in order to detect changes in time-series.
We use RTT (round trip time series) measures as data.

**Organization**

[https://github.com/Albertobegue/PAF_ChangeDetection_ANN/tree/master/tools](https://github.com/Albertobegue/PAF_ChangeDetection_ANN/tree/master/tools)
contains a few python functions we use in our code (as methods of evaluation of
the result for example)

[https://github.com/Albertobegue/PAF_ChangeDetection_ANN/blob/master/baysiancpdetection.py](https://github.com/Albertobegue/PAF_ChangeDetection_ANN/blob/master/baysiancpdetection.py)
and [https://github.com/Albertobegue/PAF_ChangeDetection_ANN/blob/master/cusum_first_implementation.py](https://github.com/Albertobegue/PAF_ChangeDetection_ANN/blob/master/cusum_first_implementation.py)
are two implementations of a simple CUSUM method and a Bayesian method to
detect changes in time-series.
